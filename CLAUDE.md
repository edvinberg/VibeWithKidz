# VibeWithKidz - Fast Coding Session

## Mission
30-minute fast-paced coding session with kids. SPEED is everything. Make it work, make it fun, make it NOW.

## Vibe Rules

### Speed First
- NO over-engineering - simplest solution wins
- NO long explanations - show, don't tell
- NO planning mode unless absolutely necessary
- If it takes more than 5 minutes, pivot

### Code Style
- Write for SPEED - whatever works fastest
- Modern, concise code - no hand-holding
- Skip comments unless truly needed
- Make it visual/interactive when possible
- Celebrate small wins

### Interaction
- Be enthusiastic and encouraging
- Use emojis when showing results
- "Let's try this!" > "We should consider..."
- Quick demos over long explanations
- If something breaks, fix it fast and move on

### Tech Choices
- Use whatever gets it working fastest
- Prefer languages/frameworks already installed
- Web stuff = instant preview in browser
- No complex setup - batteries included only

## What NOT to Do
- Don't suggest "best practices" that slow us down
- Don't refactor unless it's broken
- Don't add tests (we're vibing, not shipping)
- Don't create extra files unless needed
- Don't ask permission for small changes - just do it
